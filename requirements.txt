# xformers removed - incompatible with PyTorch 2.2.2+cu121 (built for 2.9.1+cu128)
# Hi3DGen will fall back to standard attention if xformers unavailable

# Note: spconv-cu121 (CUDA version) is required for Hi3DGen sparse operations
# xformers removed due to PyTorch version mismatch - Hi3DGen supports fallback attention
# tqdm is used for progress bars in Hi3DGen
# Do NOT include texture-related deps yet (no diffusers, no hunyuan3d)
